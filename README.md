# UFO Sightings Website 

## The UFO Sightings Website
Please open the "index.html" file with Live Server

*Once in the website, notice the data in the table. That data was pulled from the "data.js" file that you will see in the js folder.
*I was able to call that seperate data.js file by establishing a variable in the "app.js" file. Once opened, you will see that it has been called by establishing a variabel called "tabelData".

## Filtering the Site
*In the filter search, please enter a date as shown in the example text (1/11/2011). Once a date is entered, please click the "Sightings Filter" button. You'll notice it is highlighted in green and will turn completely green if hovered over.
*If the date entered is located in the data set, the filtered UFO sightings for that given date will show in the table. 
*If the date entered cannot be located in the data set, an empty table will display.
*Please manually refresh the page if you wish to reset the data.

## Enjoy looking into what we have seen and the thought of what could possibly be out there!
